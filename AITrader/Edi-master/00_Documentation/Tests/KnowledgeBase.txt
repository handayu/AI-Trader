Known resolutions
--------------------------

The file: "C:\Program Files\Edi\Edi.exe.config" contains references to modules that are loaded at run-time. MEF requires that these references
point to the actual installation folder (in particular when the application is started from a different folder than the setup folder).

Setup should normally take care of this but you can also use the following steps to solve this issue if you moved files manually.

Replace a file reference in 'Edi.exe.config': assemblyFile="Files.dll"
                   with a complete path reference: assemblyFile="C:\Program Files\Edi\Files.dll"

to resolve this problem.
